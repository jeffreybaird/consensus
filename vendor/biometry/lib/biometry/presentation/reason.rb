    # Refusals are content, not omissions. A row that could not be produced
    # says why, because a silently short table looks complete when it is not —
    # the same reason the services refuse rather than skip.
    #
    # An unrecognised tag renders rather than raising. A later slice will
    # introduce one, and a row that raised would take the whole report to exit
    # 70 over a phrasing gap.

      # It is not the table with markup stripped: the table rounds a percentile
      # to a whole ordinal because a reader comparing standards is not reading
      # a decimal place, and a program must not be handed a precision that was
      # already discarded. So values here are unrounded and brackets are
      # structured rather than phrased.

      # Refusals travel as a tag and a payload a program can branch on, for the
      # same reason the table prints them: an entry that vanished would read as
      # a standard that was never consulted.

      # Every way of dating a pregnancy that the inputs support, reported
      # together.
      #
      # There is no winner. LMP and transfer genuinely disagree by days, and
      # that disagreement is the same species as the four growth charts: the
      # caller decides which is established. The aggregate itself always
      # succeeds; the per-derivation Results are the report.
      #
      # CRL and biometry are offered and refused rather than absent. data/
      # carries no dating regression for either, and choosing among
      # Robinson-Fleming, Hadlock 1992 and INTERGROWTH is a clinical decision
      # rather than an implementer's — those standards give materially
      # different ages from the same measurement. A caller must be able to tell
      # "this library cannot do that yet" from "your inputs did not support
      # it", so the refusal is :unsupported_standard and it answers before any
      # question about the request.

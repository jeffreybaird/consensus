      # Gestational age is conventionally counted as if from a menstrual period
      # two weeks before conception, so the pregnancy is already 14 days old at
      # conception and 14 days plus the embryo's age at transfer:
      #
      #   GA at transfer = 14 + embryo_day     # day-5 blastocyst => 2w5d
      #
      # Start from day zero instead and every number downstream is about two
      # weeks out — large enough that a clinician spots it immediately, small
      # enough that no unit test you would think to write catches it.
      #
      # `embryo_day` is required and has no default. A day-5 blastocyst read as
      # a day-3 cleavage embryo is a two-day error, and guessing for a caller
      # who simply omitted it is a silent one.

      # Growth percentile by the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies (Buck Louis 2015).
      #
      # A table standard with four race/ethnicity charts and no combined one.
      # With no stratum supplied it returns all four, because race/ethnicity is
      # self-reported and is never inferred or defaulted — and because the
      # spread is the paper's own headline finding: applying the white-derived
      # chart to everyone misclassifies as much as 15% of non-white fetuses as
      # growth restricted at the 5th centile. This is the one adapter that
      # returns several rows from one call, and it returns an Array in both
      # cases so no caller has to branch on the shape.
      #
      # Weeks are read, never interpolated. Table 2 tabulates weeks 10-14 but
      # the curves were fitted from 15, so those rows are refused rather than
      # read; the CSV keeps them so it can be diffed against the published
      # table.

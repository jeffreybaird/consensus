      # An equation standard: the LMS parameters are closed-form functions of
      # exact decimal weeks, so any centile is computable and there is no
      # outermost published column to bracket against. Those are the two ways
      # it differs from the table adapters, and why a uniform lookup interface
      # across the four would be wrong.
      #
      # Every coefficient comes from the manifest's `lms.*.coefficients`
      # blocks. The functional form is here because the published equations use
      # parentheses, integer exponents and a log, all outside Equation's
      # grammar — the same division of labour as the `efw` block in slice 3.
      #
      # Its pairing is self-referential: INTERGROWTH built its centiles from
      # its own AC+HC formula, so a mismatch means something different in kind
      # from NICHD's and WHO's, which name a foreign Hadlock model.

      #
      # The second table standard, reading by the same two pinned rules as
      # NICHD: the row for the completed week, and linear interpolation in
      # weight. Those rules live in Interpolation so there is one of each
      # rather than two.
      #
      # Unlike NICHD it publishes a combined chart, so an unsupplied sex has a
      # published answer rather than a spread. Also unlike NICHD it is a
      # reference rather than a prescriptive standard — complicated pregnancies
      # were deliberately retained — so its 10th centile does not mean what
      # NICHD's does. That distinction rides in the provenance.
      #
      # Tables 14 and 15 omit the 2.5th and 97.5th columns and the loader
      # leaves those cells nil, because the absence is data. A weight is
      # bracketed against the columns the chart actually read published; a
      # sexed row is never widened from the combined one.
